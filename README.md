# DSCI532 Individual Assignment

## Motivation
Write a short motivation (max 150 words) about who your target audience is and what you aim for them to achieve using the app. This can be much briefer than the group assignment.

Example:

Target audience: Health care administrators

Missed medical appointments cost the healthcare system a lot of money and affects the quality of care. If we could understand which factors lead to missed appointments it may be possible to reduce their frequency and use the saved resources to improve patient outcomes. To address this challenge, this data visualization app allows health care administrators to visually explore a dataset of missed appointments to identify potentially underlying factors, such as the day of the week, the age of the patient, and the time between scheduling and the appointment. The app shows the distribution of factors contributing to appointment show/no show and allows users to explore different aspects of this data by filtering and re-ordering on different variables in order to compare factors that contribute to absence.

## App description
Instead of writing down a description by hand, include a short video here of you describing the app (see the next section for details). Either linking to the file or showing the video directly in the readme is fine (e.g. by uploading to another hosting service or GitHub directly by editing the file in the online interface).

## Installation instructions
Detail how to install the app and how to run it locally.
